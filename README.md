# Heston-and-Trinomial-tree-pricing-models
The project is divided into 2 parts:
1. Pricing of different options (European Call and Put, European Pay-Later Call and Put, American Put, American Pay-Later Put) using the Trinomial Lattice tree model
2. Application of the Heston stochastic volatility dynamics to analyze the sensitivity of the premium against the return-variance correlation and the volatility of variance paramenters
